# IronOxide

This is a game engine for rust in rust. I'm building it as a learning experience to try and better understand rust and what goes into a game engine.

Goals:
  1) extendable
  2) fast
  3) easy to understand

Todo:
- [ ] use hecs entity component system
- [ ] parrellize physics
- [ ] add collision callbacks
